Some more assumptions:
	* Starting position can be peak or valley (Exp: (2, 6, 4): 2, 4 will be valley, 6 will be peak)
    * Starting series (with same height) can be peaks or valleys (Exp: (2, 2, 2, 6, 5): 3 2s and 5 will be valleys, 6 will be peak)
    * Ending position can be peak or valley (Exp: (4, 6, 3): 4 and 3 will be valleys, 6 will be peak)
    * Ending series (with same height) can be peaks or valleys (Exp: (8, 4, 5, 5): 4 will be valley, 8 and 2 5s will be valleys)
